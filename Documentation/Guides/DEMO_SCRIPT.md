## 🎭 DEMO SCRIPT (5 Minutes)

### MINUTE 1: THE PROBLEM (30 seconds)
**[Show iPhone A]**

"Hi everyone! This is AccountabilityLock - an iOS app that helps you stay focused by letting someone you trust control access to distracting apps."

**[Open app, show Home screen]**

"As you can see, I'm Alex, and I have three apps blocked: Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter. Right now, they're completely locked."

**[Try to open Instagram]**

"See? iOS Screen Time blocks it. But here's where it gets interesting..."

---

### MINUTE 2: REQUEST ACCESS (45 seconds)
**[Back to app]**

"When I really need access - maybe for work or an emergency - I can request permission from my accountability partner."

**[Tap "Need Access?" button]**

"I select which app I need..."

**[Select Instagram from picker]**

"...and I can explain why."

**[Type: "Need to reply to a client message"]**

"I'll get exactly 5 minutes if approved. It's like Duo authentication, but for app access!"

**[Tap "Send Request"]**

"And... sent!"

---

### MINUTE 3: PARTNER NOTIFICATION (45 seconds)
**[Switch to iPhone B - Wait for notification]**

**[DING! Notification appears]**

"Here's the magic! My accountability partner Jordan gets an instant push notification."

**[Show notification]**

"He can see:
- Who's requesting (me)
- What app (Instagram)  
- Why I need it (client message)
- How long (5 minutes)"

**[Show two action buttons]**

"And he gets two options right in the notification: Approve or Deny."

---

### MINUTE 4: APPROVAL & ACCESS (60 seconds)
**[Tap "Approve" on iPhone B]**

"Jordan decides to trust me and approves it."

**[Tap "Approve for 5 minutes"]**

"Within seconds..."

**[Switch back to iPhone A - Show notification arriving]**

**[DING!]**

"I get approved! Access granted for 5 minutes."

**[Show green banner on Home screen]**

"The app shows exactly when my access expires - 5 minutes from now."

**[Open Instagram from home screen]**

"And boom! Instagram opens. I can reply to my client."

**[Show Instagram opening successfully]**

"The timer runs in the background. After 5 minutes, everything locks again automatically. No cheating!"

---

### MINUTE 5: THE BIGGER PICTURE (60 seconds)
**[Show Settings and Blocked Apps screens quickly]**

"Here's why this works:

**The Psychology:**
- Your partner sets the password - you don't know it
- You can't bypass the system  
- Having to ask creates accountability
- The 5-minute limit prevents mindless scrolling

**The Use Cases:**
- Parents helping teens with phone addiction
- Friends supporting each other
- Couples holding each other accountable
- Anyone wanting to build better digital habits

**The Features:**
- Works with any iOS app
- Real-time push notifications
- Secure with biometric auth
- Privacy-focused - no tracking
- Built on Firebase for reliability

**[Show blocked apps list]**

"You control which apps to block, when to block them, and who your accountability partner is."

**[Show request history]**

"You can review your request history to see patterns in your usage."

---

## 🎬 CLOSING (15 seconds)

"AccountabilityLock - because sometimes we all need a little help staying focused."

**[Show app icon and name]**

"Questions?"

---

## 🎯 KEY TALKING POINTS

### If Asked: "Can't you just delete the app?"
"Good question! The Screen Time API blocks apps at the system level. Even if you delete AccountabilityLock, the blocks remain until your partner removes them. It's enforced by iOS itself."

### If Asked: "What if my partner isn't available?"
"Requests auto-expire after 5 minutes if unanswered. You can always try again. It's designed for accountability, not punishment."

### If Asked: "Is this parental control?"
"It can be, but it's designed for voluntary accountability between adults. The key difference is mutual consent and trust."

### If Asked: "What about privacy?"
"We don't track your app usage or collect personal data. The partner only sees the apps you choose to block and when you request access. No surveillance."

### If Asked: "How much does it cost?"
"[Your pricing model here - e.g., Free with optional premium features]"

## 🎤 ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds)

"AccountabilityLock is an iOS app that helps you beat phone addiction through accountability. Here's how it works: you choose apps to block - like Instagram or TikTok. But instead of you having the password, someone you trust does - a friend, parent, or partner. When you need access, you send them a quick request. They get a push notification and can approve or deny. If approved, you get exactly 5 minutes. It's like Duo authentication, but for staying focused. Built with iOS Screen Time API, Firebase, and SwiftUI."
